# Qiskit Development Environment with Jupyter Notebook on Docker

This project sets up a Qiskit development environment using
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) on Docker. The container is based on
jupyter/minimal-notebook image, and, has Qiskit and some useful packages (check
`requirements.txt`), allowing you to develop quantum programs locally and
execute them inside the container.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Setup instructions

For a quick installation you can run the script `bash quick-setup.sh`.

### 0. Clone this repository

Firstly, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unipr-org/QC.git
```

### 1. Create required folders

```bash
cd qiskit/jupiter-notebook
mkdir code
```

> Note that the `code/` folder will be mounted inside the container and used to
> store the notebooks.

### 2. Setup group ownership

Usually, the user and group of the host and the container are different. To
avoid permission issues, you can change the group ownership of the shared
folders to the docker group.

```bash
chmod -R 774 <example-directory> <working-directory>
```

> `<example-directory>` and `<working-directory>`, set by default as `examples/`
> and `code/`, respectively.

### 3. Build the Docker container

To build the Docker image and set up the container without running it
immediately, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build --no-start
```

> This command will create the container but will **not** start it
> automatically.

### 4. Start the container

Once the build is complete, you can start the container using:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> This command will start the container in the background, and share sessions
> with the host on port 8888.

### 5. Stop and remove the container

When you're done, you can stop the running container with:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

To completely remove the container (but keep the image), you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

> This will stop and remove the container and the associated network. All
> notebooks and data won't be lost because they are stored in the shared folder
> (`code/`).

## Usage

To use the installed environment, you can access the Jupiter Notebook server by
opening the following URL in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

### VScode integration

If you are using VScode, you can install the
[Jupiter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
to edit `.ipynb` files, without interacting with the web browser interface.

Then, you can change the Jupiter kernel setting `localhost:8888` as the new one.
This allows you to execute the Jupiter file locally.

## Examples

Within the `examples/` folder, you can find examples of quantum programs that
can be executed using the Jupyter Notebook interface.

An example of a quantum program in Jupiter notebook is the following:
